but I think I will change a lot of other things too besides if I can go back into time <speaker:2> Yeah well you know I mean they say hindsight is 20/20 because I said <speaker:1> loving yourself I love it myself much more <speaker:2> Absolutely Then <speaker:1> I would love anyone else <speaker:2> That's absolutely true <speaker:1> Because we always look into for somebody else to love us and we really need to love ourselves <speaker:2> right So <speaker:1> if I could if I could truly love myself I think a lot of things would change <speaker:2> Absolutely <speaker:1> You know because when you love yourself you're confident You believe in yourself <speaker:2> That's right <speaker:1> You know nobody can tell you You don't say you want for You won't fill out a place <speaker:2> You don't need anybody else Yes when you love yourself cuz you think you need other people Love you but you really only need to love yourself <speaker:1> Yes you <speaker:2> know it's so true <speaker:1> So that's that's the deep stage that I'm going to I want somebody else to love me I want to be in love with somebody else But the thing is I'm around myself all the time <speaker:2> Right <speaker:1> Well I'm like I'm missing something I I already know I love me <speaker:2> Right But <speaker:1> I don't love me enough You know I I think I love me enough but I don't But if something is still missing <speaker:2> I've definitely in the same boat <speaker:1> So I'm trying to be happy by myself Be happy without a man It's like the man really doesn't make a woman <speaker:2> That's right <speaker:1> You know if if they could be a team and you know they can make it with each other <speaker:2> right <speaker:1> You know what I'm saying It all depends on how the person is how the personality is You know so I will I will change that I will try to love myself much more Because you know like growing up Out for Target You know you're low to yourself and you're a good person You know people tend to tend to target you <speaker:2> Right So <speaker:1> I will also change fight back You know like man I got a voice I can fight back Nobody can't do that to me no more When I was younger I don't have a voice I don't know I don't want to fight So if I can go to the time I want nobody push me over anymore <speaker:2> Yeah that's true That's a good one <speaker:1> You got a really take a stab for yourself You don't people's going to walk all over you And you don't find back It makes it worse Is it going to even more right So these are the things that I learned about myself <speaker:2> That's they're good They're really good They're important <speaker:1> You know trying to change You know I'll change a lot of bad habits and I still have a lot of bad habits because I'll try to carry the wall on my shoulders So I If I can go back to the time I will try to change that too And that people know when I need help because I try to do everything by myself What kind of used to be about myself and used to doing things by myself You used to have an apartment You used to have nobody there like you used to have no friends so I do it myself So in a way it's kind of good and a way it's kind of bad Because really I'm a people person And You know sometimes people disappoint you yeah <speaker:2> You <speaker:1> know they're not going to be who you want them to be sometimes <speaker:2> right So <speaker:1> lonely to deal with that A certain thing as they are Hello to do with that If I can go back to time I will try to accept things more as they are You know that's the way it is and nothing I can do about it and leave it alone No cuz we only try to fix things <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> Try to change people We can't change nobody but ourselves So we put the energy into the wrong thing <speaker:2> right So <speaker:1> if I go at the time I don't want to waste time no more I don't want to waste time on any other things You're not saying things that I cannot change right cuz I cannot change it I'm moving on Let me go to something else that I can change So you know I don't want to waste time On on on nothing Hello because there made no sense to me
